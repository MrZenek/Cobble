Cobble
======
Info:  
With this plugin you can enable or disable the cobblestone drop.It works exactly the same as on the server Hardcore skkf(mc.skkf.net).

Commands:  
/cobble - Showing your drop and global drop status.  
/cobble turn - changing your cobblestone drop status. (Can`t be use in console!)  
/cobble global/g on - Turn on cobblestone drop.

Instead, "global" you can use the "g"
